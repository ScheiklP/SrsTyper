# SrsTyper
A learning command line tool to practice typing.

# Ideas
* should remeber incorrect input on several levels
  * single characters (e.g. `e` instead of `i`)
  * bi/tri/quadgrams (e.g. `ht` instead of `th`)
  * single charactes, but with context of a bi/tri/quadgram (e.g. `e` is fine (for example `she` or `he`, except when found in `the`)
* should generate new text based on what you did wrong in the past, based on a spaced repetition strategy. More frequent mistakes are introduced more often into new text.
